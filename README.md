# Youtube downloader
## Bot for downloading video and audio materials from the YouTube platform using [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube).

For start download - send your searching request to the [bot](https://t.me/ytmusic_downloader_bot), the way you would search for it on YouTube. 
The bot was created to download music and clips, but you can use it how you want. The main thing is that the file doesn't exceed the Telegram size limit (50 megabyte).

[Bot](https://t.me/ytmusic_downloader_bot) deployed on heroku in sleeping mode, so after the `/start` command wait a few seconds.

Has three modes of work:
1.	Download video and audio
2.	Download only video
3.	Download only audio

To select a mode, use the `/settings` command.
